import ComplianceBadges from '../components/common/ComplianceBadges';

// Default grid layout
<ComplianceBadges size="medium" variant="default" />

// Compact row layout
<ComplianceBadges size="small" variant="compact" />
```

### Linking to Legal Pages
```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
