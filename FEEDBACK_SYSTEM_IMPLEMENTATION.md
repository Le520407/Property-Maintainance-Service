# Customer Feedback System Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive customer feedback system that allows customers to rate services and vendors to manage their customer relationships. The system has been restructured to use dedicated pages for better organization and user experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Feedback Page
- **Location**: `src/pages/customer/CustomerFeedback.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page for customers to view and rate all completed jobs
- **Features**:
  - View all completed jobs with detailed information
  - Rate services on multiple criteria (Quality, Timeliness, Communication, Value)
  - Overall rating and written feedback
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Pagination for large job lists
  - Real-time status updates

### 2. Simplified Customer Dashboard
- **Location**: `src/pages/customer/CustomerDashboard.jsx`
- **Changes**: Simplified quick actions to include single "Rate Services" button
- **Purpose**: Clean interface that redirects to dedicated feedback page

### 3. Vendor Customer Management
- **Location**: `src/pages/vendor/VendorDashboardPage.jsx`
- **Features**:

### 4. Enhanced Backend API
- **Location**: `backend/routes/vendor.js`
- **New Endpoints**:

```

## Navigation Structure

### Customer Routes
```
/customer/dashboard -> Main dashboard (with "Rate Services" button)
